## Strategy

#### User Needs
As a user the site needs to work on desktop, tablet and mobile. 
Be user friendly with clear navigation and flow through the whole experience.

#### Business vision
The purpose of this project is to help aspiring DJs. With a free step by step tutorial they will 
learn the basics. If they want to become a professional DJ's they can signup for a private session.
The ultimate goal is to get private session booked with users.

## Scope
I want my user to get excited and inspired as to what you can do with the skills of DJing. 
I want them to find a place were they can learn new skills but also relax and enjoy good music.

## Structure
The project is made up of four pages:
1. Home - The Home page has three secitons ending with a call to action; start tutorial.
2. Tutorial - Ends with a call to action, go to Playground.
3. Playground - Ends with a call to action, go to Signup.
4. Signup - Ends with a call to action, Signup and book a private lesson.

The idea is to create a natural flow for the user through the pages in that order, 
giving them structure on their journey to become a DJ. 

#### Home
On the Home page you are greeted by an image of the workstation of a DJ, turntables and a mixer. 
This image represents the whole purpose of the site. In section two you have a dark purple background contrasting 
the orange horizontal rule and white text, making it easy to read. In section three I yet again show an image of 
turntables and a mixer. This time in brighter colors, with white text glowing pink. 
The bright colors are chosen purposefully to make the user excited for the next step.

#### Tutorial
While speaking to my mentor she recommended me to use a carousel to showcase my 
tutorial, This fit really well with my plan to give the user a step by step experience.

#### Playground
This is were the user comes to listen to the end results of what a DJ can do. At the same time inspire them to
signup for a private lesson.

#### Signup
By signingup the user will be contated through email for more information on their private DJ sessions.

#### Original ideas
* The project had three pages full of text and pictures. Mentor Antonija helped me see that 
less is more. She adviced me to create sections on the first page and give the elements some room.

* I created a scroll down button on all sections on the Home page to guide the user.
but speaking with my mentor Antonija she asked If that was really necessary. We had a discussion 
and I came to the conclution that you scroll down by instinct when you enter a page, so I took that away.

* I wanted to create a decontructed upside down pyramid, created by three 
boxes on the home page. You would have the DJ Tutorial logo on the top box followed by an 
inspirational text and the scroll down text. It would all create the shape of an arrow 
pointing down. The idea was interesting but when i executed it, it dident turn out so good.
It gave a bad impression of the page and I oppted to go with less is more.

## Wireframes
I have two stages of Wireframes

* First Wireframes

![Wireframe](assets/images/wireframes/Wireframe-first-edition-two.jpg)
![Wireframe](assets/images/wireframes/Wireframe-first-edition-three.jpg)

* Second Wireframes

![Wireframe](assets/images/wireframes/Wireframe-second-edition-three.jpg)

### Changes to wireframes
I had a hard time keeping to my wireframes, since my skills and the vision for the project 
grew while I was working on it. The second wireframes are the closest to the final build. 
I felt I had no time to make new wireframes, so I used the second wireframes and build on that.
I don't recommend this because I had a lot of trail and error. I think this accually took 
more time then making new wireframes.

## Features
* Responsive Navbar menu collapsing into a hamburger dropdown menu on tablets and phones.
* Easy navigation through the pages using the navbar.
* Homepage with an images of the workstation of a DJ. 
* Soundcloud links were you can play music.
* The tutorial is in a Bootstrap Carousel for easy step by step user experience.
* Signup form to get in contact with a professional DJ.

### Future Features
* Create a multiple choice challenge for the user so they can test their skills learned.

## Technologies
This project was build using the following technologies:

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap
* Google Chrome DevTools: Helped me iterate, debug and profile my site.

### Code take from the internet and used in my project.

Navbar taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg
Carousel taken from https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp

### Bug report
#### Navbar dropdown menu does not dropdown when I click the hamburger icon.
Solution: Added <script src="script.js"></script> in the body

#### Carousel doesn't work. 
Solution: fixed carousel problem by changing id="item active" to class="item active
It stopped working because I had a lot of elements 
named by ID and when I changed it to class i forgot to change item active 
to a class too.

#### class="hide-trance-mix" did not hide the iframe
Solution: Put the closing div after the iframe

#### Chrome devtools problem that img was outside of viewport
Solution: set 100% width instead of 100vw

## Project changes during time
28-04-2021: Renamed and reworked challenge and contact to playground and sign up.

Reasoning: Playground and Sign up sounds more appealing and intuative, It's a better call to action. 
Designed so now Playground will hold my two mixes to listen two instead of the front page 
(improving load times and performance, tested in lighthouse) and some questions to test if the 
user has learned whats in the tutorial.
