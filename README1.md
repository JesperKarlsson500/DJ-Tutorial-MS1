Navbar taken from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At4B7A4GOPg
Carousel taken from https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_carousel.asp

## Bug report
### Navbar dropdown menu does not dropdown when I click the hamburger icon.
Solution: Added <script src="script.js"></script> in the body

### Carousel doesn't work. 
Solution: fixed carousel problem by changing id="item active" to class="item active
It stopped working because I had a lot of elements 
named by ID and when I changed it to class i forgot to change item active 
to a class too.

### class="hide-trance-mix" did not hide the iframe
Solution: Put the closing div after the iframe
